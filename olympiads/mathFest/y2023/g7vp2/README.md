# Mathematical Festival, 2023, [problem 2 in 7th vertical grade](https://olympiads.mccme.ru/matprazdnik/prob_23_vert.html#v7)

## Statement of the problem

Find some solution to the rebus Ф / Е + ВР / АЛЬ = 1. Different letters correspond to different digits. The slash denotes division.

## Description of the experiment

When the problem was added to the olympiad's problem list, it was known that the rebus has a lot of solutions. So to optimize solutions checking, I was asked to find all the solutions of the rebus. So that is the goal of the experiment.

You can see the code that achieves the goal in [`main.kt` file](src/main/kotlin/main.kt).
